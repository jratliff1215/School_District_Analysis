# School District Analysis
Using Anaconda to analyze standardized test scores

# Overview of the school district analysis
The school board has contacted Maria to anlyze the reading and math scores of students across the district. This information will be used to plan budgets and funding allocation for the next school year. Our firm has been contacted to combine two datasets (student data and school data) to provide a clean analysis of the information. Our firm completed the analysis on the full data sets and a reduced version of the data set. The reduction elimiated the 9th grade student scores specifically from Thomas High School. The remaining data was not modified in any form. 

# Results

  With a cutoff of 70% for a passing score, 75% of the students passed math and 85.8% or the students passed reading prior to removing 9th graders from Thomas High School. Once removed, the passing rates of students declined in both math and reading, with 74.8% and 85.7%, respectively, passing each each. Below are images from the analysis
